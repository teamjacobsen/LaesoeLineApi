This repository contains the source code for a rest api that proxies calls to the [laesoe-line.dk](http://laesoe-line.dk) booking site.

The api is hosted as a service on [laesoe-line-api.teambooking.dk](http://laesoe-line-api.teambooking.dk), and has a [Swagger UI](http://laesoe-line-api.teambooking.dk/swagger).

A client library package is [available on nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LaesoeLineApi.Client).
